# Best Fit Curve
This project aims to study the different ways in which a curve (or line) could be fit to the data  
One could input different columns for x and y, and play around the program for long time. The real beauty is the graphs which are rendered.  
Different selected values render different graphs.

If we modify the program just by two lines we could even input the data itself and use the program to find the best curve for the given data.
