# Linear Regression 
Here I would be attempting to write a piece of code in c to compute a Line that could perfectly fit a set of data points aka Linear Regression.  
<br>
**Why c ?**  
c is a very close to machine language, and can compute faster than 99% of Programming languages out there.

I have set the minum required data points to 4, because even though it takes just 2 points to find the best fit line, the algorithm doesnt work that way.
